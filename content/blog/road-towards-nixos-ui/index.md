We recently attended [NixCon 2025] in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ where we provided an __early look__ at our shiny new user interface for interacting with your Clan :tada::tada:.

{{< figure src="./screenshot.png" caption="UI 2.0">}}

Featuring __new and improved workflows__, a __fresh set of components__ and a __3D-rendered orthographic overview__, the latest version of the UI not only looks better, but it __feels better__.

Whilst it's still a work in progress, 
we're excited to start sharing it with the community and start getting your feedback.

If you came across our booth :hammer::hammer::hammer: you might have already seen it in action.

[@Kenji] and [@Qubasa] also gave a talk, _The Road Towards a NixOS UI_, in which they gave a demo of the new UI in 
action and explained how it was made possible thanks to the many building blocks we have been developing over the past 
few years.

For those who couldn't make it to Rapperwsil, you can watch a recording of the talk below.
